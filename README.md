# Emergency Responder
Emergency Responder Bot for Webex Teams

This bot is intended to support emergency situations where several disperse parties have to collaborate quickly. By initiating the bot with "help" several questions are asked it to understand the emergency situation, location, to create a Webex Teams space with the relevant persons and send SMS messages to them.
